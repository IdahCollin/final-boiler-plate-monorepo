# Open AIr Feast

As part of the Technigo Web Dev Bootcamp, this project was created as the Final Project. It includes an API, containting several different routes as well as a frontend handling all user interactions.

Our vision is to make it easier for people to connect with nature and enjoy delicious meals outdoors. Open AIr Feast generates camping stove-friendly recipes using AI. The recipes are based upon the user's input of 1-3 ingredients.

## Challenges

Stage 1 (behöver skrivas om)
Set up of boilerplate, installation. Created endpoints (no connection to AI at this time). Connected frontend to backend using the API endpoints. Implemented AI, possible to do a general prompt via the frontend localhost and get a respons in the console.

Challenges:
What kind of endpoints as we were to use AI. Solved by discussing in our team and go through material.
Old documentation AI... solved with...

How to prompt where....

Libraries: react-icons
GPT prompt: Put effort into rewriting this to get the result we want. Next step would be to fine-tune the prompt. Good way to control if recipes are up to standard, preventing the GPT to add too many ingreidents, checking whether the dishes seem edible, and that the dishes contain appropriate ampunt of nutriants and carbs for and outdoor adventure. Fine-tuning is a good way to check that the GPT actually is following instructions, eg. using only one saucepan.
