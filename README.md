As part of the Technigo Web Dev Bootcamp, this project was created as the Final Project by Emmy Dieden and Idah Collin. Open AIr Feast generates camping stove-friendly recipes by integrating with the OpenAI API. Recipe generation is based on user prompts of 1-3 ingredients and dietary requirements. Our hope by building this website is to make it easier for people to connect with nature and enjoy delicious meals outdoors. <br><br>

## API Endpoints

- GET https://ai-recipes-collin-dieden.onrender.com/: Lists all available API endpoints for reference
- GET https://ai-recipes-collin-dieden.onrender.com/recipes: Retrieves all stored recipes.
- GET https://ai-recipes-collin-dieden.onrender.com/recipes/search/:query: Searches for recipes based on a specified query. (**Note:** This endpoint is still a dummy endpoint and has not yet been implemented into the frontend.)
- POST https://ai-recipes-collin-dieden.onrender.com/openai/generateText: Initiates the process of generating a recipe using the OpenAI API.

## Database Operations

- **RecipeModel:** Represents the data structure for recipes, including user input, search words, title, description, ingredients, instructions, and creation timestamp.
- **MongoDBOperations:** Implements CRUD operations for managing recipes in the MongoDB database.

## How to Run the Project

### Backend

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone final-boiler-plate-monorepo
```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

```
cd backend
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```
npm install
```

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   Create a .env file in the backend directory and add necessary environment variables, including PORT, MongoDB connection details, and OpenAI API key.

Example .env:

```
PORT=3001
MONGO_URL=[your-mongodb-url]
OPENAI_API_KEY=[your-openai-api-key]
```

5. **Start the Backend Server**

```
npm start
```

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

```
cd frontend
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```
npm install
```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add an environment variables for the backend localhost.

Example .env:

```
VITE_BACKEND_API=[backend-localhost]
```

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server**

```
npm run dev
```

## Challenges

!!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!
Stage 1 (beh√∂ver skrivas om)
Set up of boilerplate, installation. Created endpoints (no connection to AI at this time). Connected frontend to backend using the API endpoints. Implemented AI, possible to do a general prompt via the frontend localhost and get a respons in the console.

Challenges:
What kind of endpoints as we were to use AI. Solved by discussing in our team and go through material.
Old documentation AI... solved with...

How to prompt where....

GPT prompt: Put effort into rewriting this to get the result we want. Next step would be to fine-tune the prompt. Good way to control if recipes are up to standard, preventing the GPT to add too many ingreidents, checking whether the dishes seem edible, and that the dishes contain appropriate ampunt of nutriants and carbs for and outdoor adventure. Fine-tuning is a good way to check that the GPT actually is following instructions, eg. using only one saucepan.<br><br>
