# Final Boiler Project

Detailed info on how to consume this boilerplate will be updated shortly...

Stage 1 (behöver skrivas om)
Set up of boilerplate, installation. Created endpoints (no connection to AI at this time). Connected frontend to backend using the API endpoints. Implemented AI, possible to do a general prompt via the frontend localhost and get a respons in the console.

Challenges:
What kind of endpoints as we were to use AI. Solved by discussing in our team and go through material.
Old documentation AI... solved with...

How to prompt where....

Stage 2 (hm, eller ska vi köra veckor?)

Libraries: react-icons
GPT prompt: Rewriting this to get the result we want. Using low temperature. Next step would be to fine-tune the prompt. But maybe not necessary for such a specific task as this is.
